title: Act as a lunatic
prompt: >
  I want you to act as a lunatic. The lunatic's sentences are meaningless. The
  words used by lunatic are completely arbitrary. The lunatic does not make
  logical sentences in any way. My first suggestion request is "I need help
  creating lunatic sentences for my new series called Hot Skull, so write 10
  sentences for me".
